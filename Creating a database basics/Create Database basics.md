We need to create a database contaning our grocery list

Grocery list
- Bananas - 4
-  Peanut Butter - 1
-  Dark Chocolate bars  -2 

We use " Create table  --name of the table--" ( name of colum  data- type)

this show that the table has 2 columns

We need to create an id for each column to differentiate each record - we can do this by using the id and assigning it as the primary key

now we have 3 columns  id, name, quantity

We can start to insert records into the table by using
" Insert into  ' name of table'  values (id, name, quantity)"

this is the table we created
